DESCRIPTION:At the leadership opening panel of the FOSSASIA Summit we bring technologists, developers and digital journalists together who will help us to understand what where we are heading with this rapid change. Where are opportunities, where are challenges? Panelists will provide insights from their personal perspective and their daily work. What will distinguish us from machines in future? What do we need to learn to stay ahead of the competition? What tools and technologies are most promising? Does everyone need to be a coder in future? And how can Open Technologies help us?

DESCRIPTION:<p>The FOSSASIA developer network is one of the largest communities in the Open Source world today and we are proud to have a positive impact and improving people's lives with Open Technologies. It took us years to develop approaches and processes to scale projects and we are constantly reviewing and working hard on improving ourselves. So, what is next?</p><p>What do we want to do next, what do we want to do better and how do we want to help more people, train developers, create better software and hardware and do good?</p><p>We came up with three areas, that we want to focus on:</p><p>1. In 2018, it is our goal to improve the quality of work of the FOSSASIA organization and contributions in our projects. We believe that the way to move forward is to provide project owners with more responsibilities and ownership. We aim to develop more and more into an organization that provides a framework for projects. Therefore we will continue to develop programs like Codeheat, OpenTechNights, organize meetups, participate in GSoC and GCI. We also plan to cooperate more with other organizations. Why shouldn't we run the OpenTechNights at events around the world and help to bring people together? Why shouldn't we have more OpenTechSummits with partners in China, India and Vietnam?</p><p>2. We have made very good experience with our best practices. We have seen that newcomers can progress very fast if they feel welcome and receive help and guidance from others. After they become participants in our programs many contributors move on to support others as mentors. We also see that contributors have moved to large companies, but still continue to help others in the community. This is wonderful. We want to share our experience and inspire other projects. Therefore, we plan to participate in more events, we will set up a monthly live-cast and we will run a YouTube series on these topics. While a lot of traditional school education still encourages a top-down approach we will focus our attention even more on enabling the community to collaborate on an equal level and follow the idea of sharing ideas and code freely.</p><p>3. A question that any organization and project encounters over time is how to ensure the work and setup is sustainable? What settings do projects need to succeed? While there are many non-profit organizations out there developing Open Technologies and FOSS, we also see that many people are moving on to companies that often focus on proprietary solutions and prevent contributors from continuing their engagement in the Open Tech community due to financial reasons and to support their families. At the same time, we see many projects that would have a great potential to be Open Source and at the same time commercially successful. Therefore we are starting a new dedicated FOSSASIA Accelerator that is specifically for Open Source projects. We invite projects to apply for the accelerator and investors and companies to team up with us. And, think about it, while many startups these days start with an idea, Open Source startups already have a product before any investment has started. So, these are great opportunities!</p><p>The problems in this world are too big. There is a lot of injustice, we are destroying the environment and people are even fighting each others. At FOSSASIA we want to set an example of collaboration across borders and cultures. So, please join us and let's make this a success. I wish everyone a wonderful event full of sharing and new understandings. Let's get inspired to share and learn for each other to build a better world.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>While the Intel x86-64 architecture is undisputedly market leader in the server space, several vendors have started introducing ARM64 boards. This presentation examines the suitability of ARM64 server boards for network servers. In particular, we look at the workload of a moderate-size ccTLD DNS zone (.dk) and how it would perform on ARM64 running FreeBSD.</p><p></p><p>We consider the viability of the ARM64 platform from performance and performance/power perspectives. While ARM64 is definitely slower than Intel on many workloads, it performs at least as well or better than Intel on workloads that are interesting to the internet community. Notably DNS is a very appropriate workload for ARM64.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p><span style="">Why should you use Kubernetes, an Istio Service Mesh or any choreographed Microservice architecture? There is the efficiency argument, scaling, time to market. There is the isolation argument, resilience. But in this talk, we share a different perspective: Our systems are becoming polyglot, intelligent, and rapidly moving towards an evolutionary mode where machine learning is a natural collaborator in the design thinking and coding process. Let’s play with that idea.</span></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Developing massively parallel systems is restricted by the complex tasks which need to be managed by the programmer. GPU computing provides the opportunity to parallelize data parallel algorithms while CPU can run the sequential code. With increasing algorithmic development, some new algorithms require iterations of parallel computation on the GPUs (computation scale larger than GPU memory) while some require multiple different data parallel algorithms to run simultaneously, which are notorious to be managed by the programmer.</p><p></p><p>HPX is an open-source, general purpose C++ library for developing parallel and distributed applications with a broad community usage. This talk aims to discuss the development of HPX Compute language (HPXCL) API for the integration of GPU computation with asynchronous many task execution library HPX. Asynchronous functions are provided for kernel launch, kernel execution and data transfer with the capability to hide the communication latency through computation. To give an example, computation on multiple CPU nodes, GPU nodes can all occur in parallel and can be synchronized when the results are required by the user. This system unleashes the potential to take computation to the exa-scale level.</p><p>This development is currently spearheaded by the Stellar Group Community which is a consortium of global researchers. The presenter has been a contributor to this community since his Google Summer of Code participation in 2017.</p><p></p><p>Github Link: <a href="https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpxcl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpxcl</a></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Unikernel is a novel software technology that links an application with OS in the form of a library and packages them into a specialized image that facilitates direct deployment on a hypervisor. Comparing to the traditional VM or the recent containers, Unikernels are smaller, more secure and efficient, making them ideal for cloud environments. There are already lots of open source projects like OSv, Rumprun and so on. But why these existing unikernels have yet to gain large popularity broadly? We think Unikernels are facing three major challenges: 1. Compatibility with existing applications; 2. Lack of production support (e.g. monitoring, debugging, logging); 3. Lack of compelling use case; 4. Lack of standard to Unikernels. In my presentation, I will review our investigations and exploration of if-how we can convert Linux as Unikernel to eliminate these significant shortcomings, where I name this as UniLinux, and some potential but valuable use cases to Unikernels like IoT, Serverless and IO-intensive applications.</p>

DESCRIPTION:You may think rsyslog is just a little program with ugly config file. You may say it's only routing your syslog messages from journald to plain files. But rsyslog is real swiss-army knife of logging. I'll show you how good is rsyslog in modern world of ELK, containers and JSON logs. And how bad it can be when you've missed something. It may help you to process over 100k msg/s. Or it may break your production. And it may do some neat tricks for you as well!

DESCRIPTION:<p><span><span style="">In GSoC 2017, we in a team worked together and built the Open Event Frontend which is totally decoupled from the Open Event Server. Since Open Event is a vast ecosystem, we need to ensure that each and every contributor can set up the project locally for development and can proceed faster towards contribution. Thus, it sometimes gets difficult for beginners to set up the project. In this session, I will show how to set up Open Event Frontend and Open Event Server locally and make the frontend use the local server rather than online hosted version (heroku) so that new contributors can focus on contribution rather than spending their much time in setting up the project.</span></span></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>firefly is an open source micro framework to deploy Python functions as web services. firefly was created with the aim of simplifying the deployment Machine Learning models as RESTful API. But as fate would have it, it became our favorite tool for building microservices. firefly takes care of processing the HTTP requests, forwarding the data to the python functions and encoding the result back to an HTTP request. It also has data validation, authentication support, transferring any type of file. You can also define a configuration file specifying the URL resource structure resulting in an elegant RESTful API.</p><p>
</p><p>It comes with a client library that makes calling remote functions calling as easy as calling functions present locally. It is a WSGI application and can be deployed and scaled through any WSGI server like gunicorn. There are many other features in the pipeline like multiple authentication modes through the plugin system.</p><p>This talk will focus on introducing firefly, it's notable features like plugin support, building microservices efficiently with various examples.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Having studied Haskell and Prolog at my university, I was intrigued to learn more deeply about Functional Programming.</p><p>An imperative language like Python, Java is based on 'commands', in the form of instructions and statements and are executed. These commands will have an effect. Functional languages like Haskell, OCaml revolve around the concept of 'pure functions'. A pure function is expressed as a mathematical expression only. You can evaluate the expression and there will be no side effects, for example, no I/O operations, no global state changes, no database interactions. The output is only dependent on its inputs. Hence, it is based on ‘equational reasoning’. So if you were to call a pure function with the same inputs a million times, you would get the same result every single time. Since there are no side effects, there is immutable data.</p><p>The data once initialized remains same throughout the lifetime of the code, which makes 'parallel programming' easier. Due to this immutability of data, the value of an expression is the same anywhere it might occur in the program – as long as the required variables are defined. This is termed as 'Referential Transparency'. It means that the value of an expression is the same anywhere it might occur in the program – as long as the required variables are defined. You never need to track the value of state variables or remember any updates. This enables usage of 'memoization' – you basically ‘remember’ the outputs of expensive functions with some common arguments in a sort of lookup table. This reduces the computational complexity at the expense of memory.</p><p>Functions are dealt as 'first-class citizens', i.e, you can treat them as any other objects – you can assign them to variables, you can pass them as arguments, or even get them returned from other functions. 'Recursion' is the most important aspect of functional programming, since there are no loops (which prevents any side effects). 'Higher order functions' like map(), reduce() and filter() can take functions as arguments (or return them as results), providing parallelism over sequences. Partial function application, 'currying' and 'lazy evaluation' prevents loading entire data at once into the memory. All these features provide the advantage of code re-usability, less bugs, easy testing and parallelism. </p><p>This talk will acquaint the audience with functional programming features and why is it a hot topic today.</p><p>Last 5 minutes would be left for any questions.</p>

DESCRIPTION:Biohacking is a new field of citizen science in which individuals experiment with biology . Though this talk we will be talking about democratizing biology through building low cost equipment and open source software. We will also be discussing how biological systems and systems in software and hardware intertwine and how people without experience in biology can get into biohacking. I will be bringing along some DIY lab equipment and projects(Polymerase chain reactor, incubator, prosthetics, etc ) to demo.

DESCRIPTION:<p>The growth in the development of applications using open source APIs and frameworks has created complexity with endless unmaintainable endpoints. This session will focus on my findings in building a NodeJS backend application which leverages on GraphQL and MongoDB as the database. GraphQL offers multiple functionalities in a single endpoint to communicate with front end services. In addition, I will share the advantages and disadvantages of GraphQL and how it is different from REST API. I hope this session will help you to get started in exploring this technology.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Following the first wave of cloud adoption, moving from private data centers and on-premises hosting to cloud infrastructure platforms such as AWS and GCP, we're now seeing a second wave of adoption where self-managed and operated database and messaging services are being replaced by managed cloud database services like RDS.Many of the most popular and longstanding Open Source database systems such as PostgreSQL and MySQL are available in these Database-as-a-Service platforms.  However, newer technologies used used for building scalable data pipelines are commonly proprietary, locking you into a single cloud provider and out of the vast Open Source innovation ecosystem.We'll look into into their Open Source alternatives, such as Apache Kafka and ScyllaDB and compare them with their proprietary cloud service counterparts.</p>

Addons/Extnesions are the thing that help us to personalize the browser as per our need.We use number of addons/extensions to make most of our browser. How about being on other side of table; lets create one.Webextensions APIs are here to convert us(Javascript developers) to addon/extension developers. Javascript mixed with Webextensions APIs empower us to modify our browsers to suit as per our need. Adding to awesomeness, not only for one browser but same code that can be deployed on Firefox, Chrome, Opera with minimal or no changes. In this session,  we will be learning how to develop portable addons/extensions using javascript. One can learn how to use features of browser such as Notifications, Tab capture, HTTP request handling, Toolbar buttons via addon etc. Also I will be giving a hands-on demo of creating an addon right in the session and deploying it in the browser. By the end of session, audience will be empowered enough to command their browser to perform tasks as per their wish, may be throwing notification to drink water after every hour. By this session, I look forward to increase the circle of addons/extensions developers so as to make browsers great.</p>

work deals with learning of students on complex technical concepts in much more easier way using
open source software. Mind mapping is
one of the popular learning techniques employed by the academic fraternity all over
the globe. This technique is utilized to improve the academic performance of
the students for understanding subjects and laboratory too. </span>This is because of the clear representation of the technical concepts in systematic way through mapping. This kind of learning helps students to correlate among the technical concepts without ambiguity. Though it seems to be simple it's impact is powerful as it works on cognition of Human beings. <span style="">Instead of
freehand drawing to create mind maps, open source software tools are employed. The merits of the usage of open source software are being able to create many such mind maps in short
duration, edit them at any time, able to add attractive colors and patterns to create interest and gain attention of students, design in numerous ways to develop creativity and so on. Of the majority of the methods employed, this teaching - learning technique has gained prominent importance among students. </span><span style="">The result of this work is found to be amazing among all the students for both theory subjects and practicals.
There has been phenomenon change in understanding the technical concepts and
analyzing them. </span>After witnessing its strong impact at the academic results, m<span style="">y peer academic group started using the software. </span><p></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p style=""><span style="">A
few years ago, a new type of currency emerged generalized as a “synthetic”
currency. It is called synthetic because it is not operated by any state or even has
any tangible value rather it seems to be a new asset that is trade-able resulting
from an agreement between two individuals secretly and it is facilitated with
the help of internet technology. Included in this synthetic currency is Bit
coin (BTC) that has proved to be one of the most important one. BTC can be stated as “Digital money is simply the idea that, thanks to technology, money can
now be a digital object, a unique serial number that can be directly exchanged
anonymously and without accounting, just as one person would hand a dollar bill
to another person, you had it, now they have it, Very simple”. There is already
a lot of usage of digital money, for example when a person makes a transaction
the system identifies the person and makes credit equivalent to the amount of
deposit, which makes it digitally usable on ATM machines or in transfer from
person to person or can be utilized to purchase goods or services. But this is
not related to concept of digital currencies because a digital currency is more
like a real form of currency with a characteristic of independence i.e. free
from intermediaries such as central banks. Hence the whole system of digital
currency is decentralized and there is no decision making involved by
politicians or governments or banks. Such as Bit coins work through
cryptographic algorithms to make the currency digitally usable. There are people who like the idea of currency which does
not involve people in grey suits i.e. bankers and politicians who have had the
system under control until now. In this talk, the focus is on the level of
understanding or perception among the individuals regarding the bit
coin currency in the domain of cryptocurrency.</span></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>I've wanted to build a small cloud at home for some time, mostly to 
serve as a testbed for my development projects. But also as a 
platform to virtualize my growing home infrastructure. So I allocated a 
budget of ~$1500 USD (the price of my first desktop computer) and set 
out to build a cloud using OpenStack. OpenStack is an open source cloud ecosystem designed to provide users 
with programmable open infrastructure. It  is used to power some massive private cloud deployments. But, how does it work for 
an individual wanting to deploy a cloud with their own resources? This talk will provide an overview of my experience building a small 
compute cloud from scratch, on essentially a shoestring budget; from 
hardware acquisition, through installation and configuration of the 
cloud, to my use cases for the cloud. This will serve as an introduction
 to OpenStack and getting started with it and will also cover the potential benefits you can get by having your 
own cloud at home.</p>

In this talk, I want to showcase how we can make use of the same techniques employed by AlphaGo to solve games on OpenAI Gym. The beauty of games is that we can visually inspect the output as the AI agent plays it - we will step through the logic of deep reinforcement learning, the “train of thoughts” of the AI agent and how we can code all these up in Tensorflow and Python with just our laptop or a small cloud cluster.</p><p style="">Why now? Well, AI used to be a privilege of the rich, crazy or both. Thankfully, we now have the maturity of open source technologies, availability of data science knowledge and affordable hardware for hobbyists like us to craft our own AI agents. An understanding of AI is necessary because what’s next is either the beginning of the greatest era of humanity or something out of our greatest nightmare. As geeks, we have the opportunity and responsibility to shape the development of AI, to make it accessible and beneficial to all our future generations. And of course, it all starts with this talk.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<span style=""><p style=""><span style="">Free and open source software have empowered people to have control over their lives, which are increasingly dominated by computer technology and notably, software. A weakness in this ecosystem is that tangible Internet services are dominated by companies that operate centralized, cloud-based services. These run counter to the tenets of free and open source software despite the fact these services often use this very software.</span></p><p style=""><span style="">The proper use and application of such free and open source software for Internet services is important. This comes in the form of decentralized services, themselves powered by free and open source software. </span></p><p style=""><span style="">Neeraj will discuss a very specific use case of decentralized Internet services -- the idea of a decentralized key-value pair database network powered by AGPL software. The network is enabled by a crypto-economy of producers and consumers that all use this AGPL software in the form of daemons, API’s, libraries, and tools. The talk will focus on the need for decentralized services and how they are the embodiment of the spirit of free and open source software, when it comes to the use and application of such software, with a brief discussion on the world decentralized database case study.</span></p></span>

But the problem is not the data, it's figuring out what we need from the data.</span><span style="">If you ask yourself "what makes my community healthy?" you may soon discover that the question is not so easily answered. Contribution levels, downloads, user interactions... these all sound good, but do they always answer the community health question? Depending on where a community is in its lifecycle, they may not. And, complicating the matter is that different projects have completely different end goals--more users vs. more contributors, for example. </span><span style="">In this presentation, Brian Proffitt examines the questions that need to be asked in order to determine the answers for community health.</span></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p style=""><span style="">At Episource, we work on building Deep Learning
frameworks and architectures to help summarize a medical chart, extract medical
coding opportunities and their dependencies to recommend best possible ICD10
codes. This not only required building a wide variety of deep learning
algorithms to account for natural language variations but also fairly complex
in-house training data creation exercises.</span></p><p style=""><span style="">A big part of any deep learning based product is
data. Algorithms v/s Data debate has transformed into a contentious one off
late. But general consensus has been biased towards voluminous quality data
over deep layered networks. Especially in NLP, people are ready to give an arm
and leg to get their hands on quality data.</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">That was a very early
realization that our team had when we were starting off the planning phases for
the NLP engine. </span><span style=""></span></p><p><span style="">We have been working
on creating a scalable NLP engine for scalable information extraction
from medical discharge summaries. What makes the problem statement even more
difficult is the lack of quality training data as well as the wide domain
expertise needed to succeed in this use-case. So, we focused on building solid
and scalable data collection pipelines before building algorithms. And so, we
did.</span><span style=""></span></p><p><span style=""> </span></p><p style=""><span style="">We have been generating in-house
training Data in a peer-reviewed 3 level QA system. Our models have to ingest
annotated data for better performance, so it was important to ensure quality. Now,
the issue was, the training data itself being Patient Healthcare
Information (PHI) which makes it trickier if we are to be HIPPA compliant. We
also had to make sure that the data being annotated in encrypted and no patient
information is accessible to external parties to ensure HIPPA compliance.
</span></p><p style=""><span style="">We architected and deployed a secure
&amp; scalable cloud platform for data collection plus annotation using Open
Source tools like Brat and Docker. We deployed the solution on AWS using VPCs, load
balancers, EFS and S3. Now, we have crossed 20K annotated training data
samples, which is a treasure mine for our data-hungry algorithms.</span></p><p style=""><span style="">The talk will focus on digging deeper
into the problem statement above, as well as explaining some of the constraints
that go into building a deep learning based clinical decision support system
while remaining on the fair side of legal and business guidelines. We
will majorly talk about our learnings in building annotation pipelines for
training data creation and deep learning frameworks specifically from a
point of view of Clinical Named Entity Recognition systems.</span><span style=""> </span></p>

Instead of writing a custom program for each problem, we can describe the problem in MiniZinc and then use a generic solver to find the solution. This session will demo how we can model a variety of problems in MiniZinc, a free and open-source constraint modelling language.

If we want to keep our sovereignty over our data, protect our privacy and prevent vendor lock-in then we need open source self hosted and federated alternatives. The internet and the web use a distributed and federated architecture. Now we have to make sure that cloud services follow the same model. </p><p>A new challenge is the increasing blending of application hosting and storage as seen at Office 365 and Google Suite. This has the danger to lead to a very strong vendor lock-in. </p><p>This talk will discuss the ongoing trends in this areas and possible solutions. It will also give an overview of newest Nextcloud features and the long term roadmap to provide an alternative to centralised services.</p>

As a result, companies are required to provide processes and infrastructure to allow data access to Business Intelligence and Development teams without compromising on regulatory requirements. To solve this problem, there is some commercially available software which encrypts data at rest by using key management within or outside the RDBMS. But we have been able to solve this problem innovatively by using triggers and a set of Python scripts which is free, masks data in real time, has simple to configure columns for masking and retains the usability of data after masking. We have developed a set of functions for each type of sensitive data that is used in various applications most commonly. We will also discuss pros and cons.</span></p>

While there are plenty of good reasons for this line, many decision makers in the public administration are still unaware.</p><p>Digital services offered and used by our public administrations are the critical infrastructure of the 21st century. In order to ensure our systems are trustworthy and reliable, governments and businesses must have full control over the software and the computer systems at the core of the state digital infrastructure. However, right now, this is rarely the case due to restrictive licensing models that:</p><ul><li>Prevent sharing and exchanging publicly funded code.

We need software that guarantees transparency, government oversight and trust. We need software that helps public administrations and businesses regain full control of their critical digital infrastructure, allowing them to remain sovereign and provide their services to the citizens.

DESCRIPTION:<p><span style="">In overall success of localization timely translation and their packaging/shipping for targeted release matter the most. Plus packaged translations should be tested as well. In some cases upstream manages the workflow and in another may it be managed for downstream only. In total a sync between upstream, translation platform and build system seem missing. Which actually results in delay or poor localized interfaces. Transtats is an attempt to fill this gap. It answers some of the questions like (1) Translation status of packages at all three places (2) Translation workload estimation for coming release (3) Translation coverage of a list of packages in a set of languages for a given release. Along with this, it can automate a few steps of l10n workflow as well.</span><span style="">Lets discuss Transtats in detail.

DESCRIPTION:<p>Many of the chatbots today are still based on rule-based backends. They are, effectively, regurgitating pre-configured contents by traversing a tree-like conversational flow based on the intents of the text entered by human users. The main issue arises when a human user enters some text that has not been included in the conversational tree. Therefore, there has been strong interest in approaches that can solve the challenging problem of Question Answering. The goal is to automatically answer questions posed by human users in natural language, without conversational trees. This talk will address the roles that open source softwares play in the use of deep learning and neural networks on our journey to tackle the Question Answering problem. We will also discuss how this approach differs from classical approaches. </p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>The project aims at proposing a solution to restore underwater images for Marine Archeological studies. This work was done during a research internship at CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography. We worked with datasets provided by the field work and underwater explorations in the Arabian Sea along Western Coast of India. In this project, the traditional image restoration approach is extended by incorporating underwater optical properties into the system response function. Underwater turbidity causes loss of clarity transparency, visibility and the luminosity in underwater images to study a particular scene for Marine Archeologists. In this project, we have implemented and compared different methods of underwater image enhancement and restoration which are degraded by the turbidity in water. We implemented the various image processing algorithms considering an average quality camera (i.e., Logitech C920). The algorithms implemented in a step-wise manner are preprocessing, filtering, enhancement and denoising based on a model. Images tend to get degraded as the depth and turbidity increases, the amount of light on objects decreases and light distribution becomes nonuniform. To tackle this issue, the input images are converted to YCbCr color space and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is performed on the Luminescence(Y) channel of the image which improves the local contrast, at the same time limiting the amplification which can over-amplify the noise too. The filtering and enhancement were done using the Bilateral Filter and then finally the enhancement was carried out using the wavelet denoising method and de-blurring. Due to the intensity variations involved in underwater sensing, denoising is carefully carried out by wavelet decompositions. This is necessary to explore different effects of restoration constraints, and especially their response to an underwater environment where the effects of scattering can be easily treated as either signal or noise.</p><p>Since our solution aided the marine archeologists in their studies, we gave more emphasis to the information extraction and the visibility of features rather than the enhancing the physical features of the underwater images.</p>

DESCRIPTION:TagUI is an open-source tool for automating UI interactions. Use cases include process automation, data acquisition and testing of web apps. It was built with focus on web-apps, but the focus is now expanding to desktop apps as well, using visual automation. Eventually, people will probably know it as an open-source RPA (robotic process automation) tool. It basically takes in 21 different human languages describing UI interactions and translate them into working JavaScript code to drive automation of sequences of actions (personal or business process workflows). It does not have AI / machine learning capabilities yet. Part of my job scope at AI Singapore is to integrate AI capabilities into the tool and continue releasing it with an open-source license. TagUI Features * automate Chrome, Firefox, PhantomJS * visual automation of websites and desktop * write in 20+ human languages &amp; JavaScript * Chrome extension for recording web actions * unzip and run on macOS, Linux, Windows * R &amp; Python integration for big data / AI * run by schedule, command line, API URL * advanced API / command calls to services

DESCRIPTION:<p>Most of the people really like GUI, WebUI, smartphone application such as Thunderbird, Gerrit, Slack, etc. I think 
they are really fancy and cool. However, it sometimes requires 
complicated operation with a mouse, swipe and taps. Moreover, it's a bit difficult to tell how to operate to the others. To do so, we need a lot of 
screenshots of that application. It makes our productivity low. So, instead of that, there are a lot of CUI/CLI 
tools as alternatives. They are really simple but powerful and fast. In 
this session, audience can see the benefit of CUI/CLI tools. And, as a 
developer, making a fancy GUI application is really hard. We actually have a lot of options not only using GUI applications 
but also CUI/CLI ones.

I really love CUI/CLI applications recently. Because it's simple, fast, 
lightweight and can be operated with only a keyboard not mouse. In this 
talk, I'll give some example GUI and CUI/CLI apps and talk about its pros/cons.</p><p></p>

Standalone Kubernetes still requires a layer of management and Kubernetes alone isn’t the answer developers are looking for.</span> </p><p style=""><u></u></p><p style=""><span style="">Times are changing - Virtual Machines are too slow, too heavy weight and frankly expensive for some customers workloads. This is where containers fill the gap for flexibility, scalability, light-weight infrastructure matched with a per-second billing model, customers get exactly what they pay for. You could run a container on a VM - but this is a huge waste of “space” when you think about how much compute you actually need versus the amount of time you are running the job for. Azure Container Instances and other pods as a service platforms like <a href="http://Hyper.sh" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hyper.sh</a> or Fargate from Amazon, is the story for flexible billing, instant compute power and efficiency within the cloud. Now customers can provision as many light weight containers as they want and have fast start up times with one command. This changes the game for deploying infrastructure. Developers have an easier job of provisioning and deploying their infrastructure and only have to worry about their direct customer interactions and content, with their applications.</span></p>

DESCRIPTION:I worked on implementing collaborative editing using Operational Transformation algorithm with Typeset in my summers internship 2017. <p>There are various papers on both the methods of implementing collaborative editing : <strong>Operational Transformation</strong>, which goes back to 1989, when it was first implemented by the GROVE (GRoup Outtie Viewing Editor) system (this algorithm is quite old, and Google uses this algorithm for collaborative editing for Google Docs, Google Slides, Wave, etc) and <strong>Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</strong>, which is a much newer approach to real-time editing.</p><p></p>Real challenge of collaborative editing<p></p><p>If you know how real-time collaborative editing works, then you may know that handling concurrent editing in multi-user environment gracefully is very challenging. However, a few simple concepts can simplify this problem. The main challenge, as mentioned, with collaborative editing is the concurrency control [<strong>concurrent edits</strong>] to the document are not commutative. This needs to be causally ordered before applying either by undoing history or by transforming the operations [<strong>operational transformation</strong>] before applying them to make them seem commutative.</p><p></p>Bringing Latency into action<p></p><p>Introducing latency between the client and server is where the problems arise. Latency in a <span>collaborative</span> editor introduces the possibility of version conflicts. Here, where, I said Operational Transformation will come into action.</p><p></p><p>Let’s take an example :</p><p></p><p><strong>Starting Client’s state :</strong></p><p></p><p>ABCD</p><p></p><p><strong>Starting Server’s state :</strong></p><p></p><p>ABCD</p><p></p><p>Now, let’s say, <em>Client</em> enters X in between C and D , the operation would look something like this :</p><p></p><p>insert(X,3) //where 3 is the position where x is going to be added (0=A, 1=B, 2=C ..)</p><p></p><p>And at the same time, <em>Server</em> deletes,b the operation would be :</p><p></p><p>delete(B,1)</p><p></p><p>What actually should happen is that the client and server should both end with ACXD but in reality, <em>client</em> ends with ACXD</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD"Insert 'X'" operation at offset 3 [local] -&gt; ABCXD"Delete 'B'" operation at offset 1 [remote] -&gt; ACXD<p></p><p>but the <em>server</em> ends with acdx.</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD"Delete 'B'" operation at offset 1 [local] -&gt; ACD"Insert 'X'" operation at offset 3 [remote] -&gt; ACDX<p></p><p>Of course, ACXD != ACDX and the document which is shared now is in the wrong state.</p><p></p><p>Here is where the <strong>Operational Transformation</strong> algorithm comes to the rescue.</p><p></p>Operational Transformation Algorithm<p></p><p>Operational Transformation (OT) is an algorithm/technique for the transformation of operations such that they can be applied to documents whose states have diverged, bringing them both back to the same state.</p><p></p>How does Operational Transformation work?<p></p><p>A short overview of how OT works :</p><p></p><ul><li>Every change (insertion or deletion) is represented as an <strong>operation</strong>. An operation can be applied to the current document which results into a new document state.</li><li>To handle concurrent operations, we use the <strong>tranform</strong> function that takes two operations that have been applied to the same document state (but on different clients) and computes a new operation that can be applied after the second operation and that preserves the first operation’s intended change.</li></ul><p></p><p>Let’s apply Operational Transformation in the original example.</p><p></p><p>If we apply OT, <em>Client</em> will see :</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD"Insert 'X'" operation at offset 3 [local] -&gt; ABCXD"Delete 'B'" operation at offset 1 [transformed] -&gt; ACXD<p></p><p>and <em>Server</em> will see :</p><p></p>Starting Document State -&gt; ABCD"Delete 'B'" operation at offset 1 [local] -&gt; ACD"Insert 'X'" operation at offset 2 [transformed] -&gt; ACXD //Transform function would add add it in the new (3 - 1 = 2) position<p></p>Client — Server [OT] Approach to Collaborative Editing<p>The <strong>transform</strong> function is used to build a client-server protocol that can handle collaboration between any number of clients.</p><p>Choosing a Client-Server architecture will allow scouting a large number of clients without actually complicating the environment. Also, there will be a single system which holds the source of truth i.e. the server, so even if the clients crash/go offline for a long time, we can go back to the server and fetch the document easily.</p><p>This source of truth also forces the client to wait for the server to <strong>acknowledge</strong> the operation that the client has just sent which would mean that the client always stays on the server’s OT path. This would help in keeping a single history of operations without actually having to keep a mirror of the state for each client that is connected. That would eventually mean the number of clients that are connected to the server would have only one single copy of the document on the server.</p><p></p>Conclusion<p></p><p><strong>Operational Transformation</strong>
 is a very powerful tool that allows to build great collaborative apps 
with support for non-blocking concurrent editing. I am looking forward 
to dive deep into the algorithm (and ofcourse extending this blogpost) 
and possibly working on an editor which supports it as well.</p><p></p>

 <li style=""><span style="">How NLP works and the impact it has on different languages.

Due to which I decided to work in this field and how I made a distributable POS tagger with 77% accuracy.</span></li>
</ul><ul style="">
 <li style=""><span style="">How you can build a cool and actually useful NLP tool for any language without knowing calculus, fancy statistics or even the language itself, just like I did. Also, learn the process of building these tools and my experience building one.</span></li></ul><ul style="">
 <li style=""><span style="">Why NLP on Regional Languages are not so popular and what led these languages to be so technologically backward and how we can change it by building tools like </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Genre classification</span><span style=""> to </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spam filtering</span><span style="">, </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Generating new article headlines</span><span style="">, </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speech Recognition</span><span style=""> and </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Describing the contents of an image </span><span style="">which could be the single most revolutionary technology made for the visually impaired (millions) who are not well versed in English and more enabling them to access the internet.</span></li></ul><p>











</p><ul style="">
 <li style=""><span style="">How such Open Source tools can change the world. Also, how you can push your career forward by building and publishing such tools in the meantime, just like I did. The revolution we could be a part of, by having an organisation for building such tools for different languages, to make young contributors from a very diverse crowd, from all around the world, from all different languages united by a common goal of building ML tools and making lives better and how we can potentially represent every minority languages and make a huge impact on a LOT (still an understatement) of people, potentially billions.</span></li>

We'll go from learning what JSON Web Tokens are, why they're the driving force in API security, and to put theory into practice actually build a real world implementation using Node.js and Angular where we'll show common best practices.</span>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Today’s global climate of international development funding cuts, along with growing challenges in sustainability of FOSS projects generally, means we need to focus on co-investment in shared resources for those projects -- the mission of the DIAL Open Source Center. </p><p>Duplication of effort, flawed funding models, and overall lack of project maturity has led to the failure of most free &amp; open source software projects in the international development space. In this talk, we'll discuss the new Open Source Center at the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL), an initiative of the United Nations Foundation. The Center's aim is to help increase those projects' maturity, quality, and reach -- with a goal of advancing an inclusive digital society using FOSS for the poorest places on the planet.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>XA stands for “eXtended Architecture”, and is a standard
    created by The Open Group for distributed 
    transaction processing. XA addresses the problem of preserving ACID
    properties within a single transaction across a distributed set of resources. The resources
    themselves could be other MySQL servers, or even different database technologies. MySQL 5.0
    introduced XA support, thus adding the ability to participate in global transactions. MySQL 5.7 has removed
    major limitations in the XA transaction recovery mechanism and binary logging mechanism.
    
    This talk would cover the following points:
    * What is XA?
    * How does MySQL support the XA standard?
    * How to perform XA transactions in MySQL.
    * Improvement made in 5.7 for XA transaction recovery.
    * Improvement made to use XA transaction safely with replication.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Urban computing is the process of acquisition, integration and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by diverse sources in urban spaces to tackle the major issues that cities face today and in the future. In other words, the goal of urban computing is to help us understand the nature of urban phenomena and make cities "smarter". An example of which is how autonomous vehicles would transform the future of urban mobility. This talk surveys the fundamental concepts, methods and problems in urban computing. I particularly focus on the methods of machine learning and data visualization for urban computing research and practice. I finally introduce a generic machine learning solution framework based on spatiotemporal data to solve urban computing problems with real-world applications in urban transportation and law enforcement.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>The four classical temperaments are Melancholic, Phlegmatic, Sanguine and Choleric. Temperaments are more core to individuals than personality. Each temperament has unique qualities, strengths and weaknesses. In this short talk their correspondence to the modern psychological DISC personality types will be shown. It is interesting to discover that the human temperaments are not just psychological but can also express themselves physically. By the end of the session we will attempt to group the participants by their dominant temperament and see if there are any commonalities.</p><p>Understanding the four temperaments and how they relate, helps one to understand people in daily life and improve human interactions in the workplace, at home, and outside.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>The MySQL Performance Schema is a feature for monitoring Oracle's MySQL Server execution at a low level. This versatile and tightly integrated component collects performance and session data from various subsystems within the server during runtime with minimal impact on overall server performance.With help of few real world use cases, this talk aims to explain how/what statistical information user is provided with using Performance Schema. With these use cases, it also explains how this information can be used for monitoring and trouble shooting to track an issue back to the relevant file and line of code in source file. Again, with some use cases, this talk also explains how Performance Schema gives consolidated view of different activities of MySQL server behind the scene with the multiple summary tables and how this can be tuned and used. This talk also covers the manual/automatic configuration of Performance Schema to suite to individual requirement in a specific scenario.This talk is targeted to many database users which includes DBA, Database Application developers, Database developers, Students. This talk is to give overview of MySQL Performance Schema and also how/what information can be collected using it and how this information could be used further for debugging/trouble shooting Database users' issue.Takeaways from the talk: - Overview of tuning and monitoring MySQL Server activities using Performance Schema. - Understanding of how to tailor the Performance Schema to track the data you want. - With few real world usecases, explain how to diagnosing problems with the Performance Schema.  - A glimpse of new features in Performance Schema in MySQL 5.7 GA.</p>
