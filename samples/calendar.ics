DESCRIPTION:<p><span style="">As society and technology become more deeply
  intertwined\, society is taking interest in -- and influencing -- nuanced
  technological issues\, ranging from net neutrality\, to the selection of 
 emojis\, to the enforcement of open source licenses. The FOSS community ta
 kes for granted the values of open source\, but the benefits can be diffic
 ult to explain to those who are not empowered to utilize the source. This 
 talk examines some of the cultural and technological barriers that have st
 ymied inclusiveness\, using gender imbalance as a case study. Finally\, we
  propose a solution which we call "Love to Code"\, which attempts to addre
 ss the issue of inclusiveness in technology.</span></p>

 SQL\, or how to teach an elephant to dance rock'n'roll.</span><span style=
 "">Query performance is usually tuned by simply adding indexes and rewriti
 ng the query minimally\, while the basic idea of the query stays the same.
  For many query\, this is not the best way to optimize them: you need to r
 ethink and rewrite them completely. To do this\, you need to know how opti
 mizer and executor work\, and keep that in mind while composing your queri
 es. In this talk\, I will present an overview of a few less known and rare
 ly used techniques such as:</span><span style="">* using and implementing 
 loose index scan for different scenarios\;</span><span style="">* using IO
 S in situation where it isn't applicable directly\;</span><span style="">*
  replacing IN (long list of values) with JOIN VALUES ()\;</span><span styl
 e="">* moving a limit or offset clause inside joins\;</span><span style=""
 >* and other tricks with row types and arrays of row types.</span><span st
 yle="">Using these techniques and some other ideas\, we will learn how to 
 optimize a 'friends feed/subscription news' query\, which is a typical tas
 k in many projects. We will diretcly compare performance of four different
  approaches: direct approach (simplest query)\, optimized direct approach 
 (more complicated version of it)\, pl/pgsql with different algorithms\, an
 d implementation of this pl/plsql code in plain sql. I will show how this 
 approach can convert almost any read-only non-dynamic (no EXECUTE statemen
 ts and no exceptions) pl/pgsql code to a plain sql query.</span></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Scientific research is producing amazing results at high ra
 te. However it is incredibly difficult for non-experts to understand such 
 studies and their implications. The open source technology movement simpli
 fies those concepts and allows the understanding of these works. This enab
 les citizen to answer scientific questions affecting directly their lives.
  The "Rock your Rainbow" project aims to disassemble already existing open
  source spectrometers\, and re-design the modules to be flexible and compa
 tible with custom built devices. With this tool it is possible to approach
  spectrometry: simple examples are the analysis of light bulbs emission sp
 ectra and its influence on our psycophysical health\, or the classificatio
 n of plant pigments.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p><span style="">The OpenStack Community's CI System operates
  at a tremendous scale\, with on average roughly 12 thousand test jobs lau

 . However there is an issue\, it is too difficult for humans to deal with 
 all the data being generated or analyze all the results from the testing. 
 To deal with this the OpenStack community has developed and deployed sever
 al tools to help deal with the torrent of data. Using and building off the
 se tools have been invaluable especially as the OpenStack project continue
 s to grow. This talk will explain the basics of OpenStack's CI infra and c
 over the approach and tooling used by the OpenStack community to interact 
 with the large amount of test result. It will explain the techniques used 
 and the benefits derived from having both open test result data and perfor
 ming analysis on that data to understand the project.</span></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p><span style="">The Moore's law has almost come to an end an
 d not much performance up gradation can be achieved just by upgrading hard
 ware generations. </span><span style="">The methods of frequency scaling a
 nd core multiplication have reached their maximum limits of exploitation a
 nd cannot be explored further. This gives rise to the need for heterogeneo
 us computing.Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than 
 one kind of processor or cores. </span><span style="">These systems gain p
 erformance or energy efficiency not just by adding the same type of proces
 sors\, but by adding dissimilar co-processors\, usually incorporating spec
 ialized processing capabilities to handle particular tasks.</span><span st
 yle="">There are a number of heterogeneous devices that are readily availa
 ble off the shelf\, some of them as commercially available system on chips
  (SoCs) and can be easily accessible to the average embedded software prog
 rammer. These heterogeneous devices incorporate hardware accelerators\, su
 ch as GPUs and FPGAs. The advantages of having multiple types of hardware 
 accelerators within a system on chip are many\, such as high-performance g
 ains and specificity of tasks performed. One of the major issues is the ex
 otic programming model that each hardware accelerator brings along with it
 . </span><span style="">FPGAs bring along the requirement to write acceler
 ators using hardware description language (HDL) at a very low level of abs
 traction (register transfer level) which has a really steep learning curve
 \, extremely long compilation/place and route timings and are relatively d
 ifficult to debug. GPUs have their own programming languages and until a f
 ew years ago GPUs were used predominantly for graphics processing as the n
 ame suggests. However off late\, with computing problems of large sizes an
 d datasets\, a lot of computations are being off-loaded to the GPU due to 
 its benefit in parallel execution. </span><span style="">Even with a great
  number of devices available\, the difference in programming models makes 
 it difficult to truly use all these devices in unison. </span><span style=
 "">Even with these multitudes of methods available for hardware accelerati
 on\, it is still not possible for software developers to adopt and use the
 se devices as part of their daily routine for hardware acceleration. In or
 der to achieve the full potential of hardware acceleration\, multiple hete
 rogeneous devices within the same SoC must be programmable using a single 
 programming model and also the programming model must be portable across d
 evices without loss of functionality. The aim of this talk is to throw lig
 ht on the OpenCL(Open Computing Language API) and its potential for being 
 the one single language that can be used to program multiple devices.</spa

DESCRIPTION:<p><span style="">In recent years\, applicable area of Postgre
 SQL has quickly extended into the enterprise sector thanks to continuing e
 ffort of the community to improve performance and functionality. As a resu
 lt\, there is an emerging demand to use PostgreSQL in more security-critic
 al circumstances.</span><span style="">In this presentation\, I will talk 
 about the following two topics.</span><span style="">  * Considerations fo
 r securing a database system.</span><span style="">  * Current status of d
 atabase audit on PostgreSQL</span><span style="">I am working for the  ope
 n source software center (OSS center) of NTT which is the largest telecomm
 unications company group in Japan. We have encouraged many of our customer
 s to migrate a lot of database systems to PostgreSQL so far and this contr
 ibuted much to cost reduction.</span><span style="">Some projects need to 
 conform to security standards\, for example PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry
  Data Security Standard). It is one of the most prevailing security standa
 rd in the world. However it is not easy to build and operate a PostgreSQL-
 based system conformant to these security standards. I'd like to describe 
 some aspects required for secure database systems in general\, such as enc
 ryption\, key management\, identity management and auditing.</span><span s
 tyle="">Then I explain considerable points for building a secure database 
 system using PostgreSQL\, and show the remaining challenges for secure dat
 abase systems using PostgreSQL.</span><span style="">Finally\, I introduce
  a forked version of pgaudit that we are maintaining\, then explain how to
  use it. pgaudit is developed by 2ndquadrant and Crunchy Data\, especially
  by David Steel with a great contribution. However\, it does not meet our 
 customer's requirements. For example\, It cannot output the audit log and 
 server log separately\, it cannot audit Superuser fully\, etc. So we forke
 d it and added some changes.</span></p>

DESCRIPTION:<p><span style="">The project deals with developing various mo
 bile applications (Apps) using free and open-source web application for he
 aring impaired children. The work has been done in association with a Non-
 Governmental Organization (NGO) called SAHI\,  Society to Aid the Hearing 
 Impaired which is part of Apollo Hospitals\, Hyderabad. SAHI supports the 
 hearing impaired kids for Cochlear implant surgery so that the kids audibi
 lity increases. After the surgery audio therapy is given to kids for bette
 r understanding of the surrounding world. By using free and open source we
 b applications\, MIT App Inventor\, various mobile Apps have been develope
 d for the better learning of the kids. The learning of the impaired kids h
 ave been cleared explained by the special teachers to the developers. This
  made to develop Apps more clearly\, concisely and perfectly. Different Ap
 ps were done keeping in the view of international standard of teaching to 
 special kids who are hearing impaired. The Apps developed covered variety 
 of topics such as Early Vocabulary\,Vehicle and Voice Sounds\, Syllable Le
 ngth Word (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu)\, Discrimina
 te Consonant\, Same Length Words (in English and local languages - Hindi a
 nd Telugu)\, Leaning by Manner\, Learning of Colors\, Learning various Poe
 ms (in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu) and explaining shor
 t Stories(in English and local languages - Hindi and Telugu). The Apps hav
 e been done in both English and native languages too keeping in view of th
 e therapy requested by the kid's parents. Tests are also included in the A
 pps to know the level of learning. During initial stages\, suggestions wer
 e given by audiologists\, special teachers and counselors. After continuou
 s and rigorous reviews and feedbacks\, the apps developed had become satis
 factory to all the special trainers and was ready to use. They were given 
 to the challenged kids for testing as a part of their learning. The result
 s found by the teachers were astounding. Children are showing more interes
 t to learn on mobile rather than book. The duration of attention  towards 
 learning of the kid has drastically improved. Teachers training the specia
 l kids are very happy with this m-learning (Mobile learning). Parents too 
 found it to be amazing as their kids show more interest towards learning t
 hrough mobile. Also\, now they are very much comfortable to train the kids
  at their homes by using these Apps. The parents are very excited to get a
 ll these learning Apps shared to their mobiles.  It  is a great feeling of
  satisfaction to see kids interested to learn and the parents with bright 
 smile on their face. This all happened by developing learning Apps of open
 -source software. Over all it's an awesome experience !!</span></p>

 Toolkit (CLTK)\, a project bringing natural language processing to ancient

 "">The CLTK core is a Python library that offers natural language processi
 ng support for Classical languages (namely\, those of ancient Eurasia\, fr
 om earliest civilizations through the beginning of the modern era). It can
  be seen as an extension of NLTK\, but with special consideration for the 
 unique needs of historical languages. It provides basic functions for many
  languages (e.g.\, n-grams\, word frequencies\, word tokenization) and wid
 er support for several languages (Greek and Latin) that includes text norm
 alization\, sentence tokenizer\, POS tagging\, and named entity recognitio
 n (NER). We plan to extend to other languages\, as well.</span><span style
 ="">The CLTK Archive is a website I worked on during my GSoC project. It's
  a web app front-end to the CLTK core and also provides a modern reading e
 nvironment for interacting with ancient texts. The Archive aims to provide
  an aesthetically-pleasing yet utilitarian environment that facilitates re
 ading\, note taking\, and learning. It presents Classical texts in an easy
 -to-read layout with metadata like translation\, commentary\, and word def
 initions. The site is backed up by a Flask based REST API that provides ac
 cess to text corpora and other functions of the core CLTK package. </span

DESCRIPTION:<p>In this talk\, I will be talking about the development and 
 release process of the mobile app for the Indian Prime Minister's office. 
 Google and Government of India initially started a contest to crowd source
  the features and design of the appOur team won the contest in the end and
  were to make the official app for the PMO. I was the lead Android develop
 er of the team. I will be talking about how we worked with the government 
 and will talk about five aspects of the app - Development\, scalability\, 
 security\, release and maintenance. I will talk about localization of apps
  as our app is currently targeting 10 regional languages in India with dyn
 amic content. We had to get multiple security clearances from different go
 vernment and private agencies due to the nature of the app which included 
 automated source code testing\, white boxtesting\, blackbox testing and ma
 nual testing. Due to the expected high load on the app\, we did multiple l
 oad tests on the app before launch to configure servers and load balancers
 . Finally I will talk about the release process of the app and the ongoing
  maintenance.Contest Details - <a href="http://www.google.co.in/intl/en_i

DESCRIPTION:<p>The Shogun Machine learning toolbox provides a wide range o
 f unified and efficient Machine Learning (ML) methods. The toolbox seamles
 sly allows to easily combine multiple data representations\, algorithm cla
 sses\, and general purpose tools. This enables both rapid prototyping of d
 ata pipelines and extensibility in terms of new algorithms. We combine mod
 ern software architecture in C++ with both efficient low-level computing b
 ackends and cutting edge algorithm implementations to solve large-scale Ma
 chine Learning problems (yet) on single machines.One of Shogun's most exci
 ting features is that you can use the toolbox through a unified interface 
 from C++\, Python\, Octave\, R\, Java\, Lua\, C#\, Ruby\, etc. This not ju
 st means that we are independent of trends in computing languages\, but it
  also lets you use Shogun as a vehicle to expose your algorithm to multipl
 e communities. We use SWIG to enable bidirectional communication between C
 ++ and target languages. One of the focus point of the talk is the introd
 uction of the meta-example framework developed as part of the toolbox: a u
 ser can write an example use-case for a method using our 'meta-example' sy
 ntax\, that would then be auto-translated into all of the supported langua
 ges of the library. This not only allows us to easily scale with the numbe
 r of new methods in the sense of having the example use-cases of the metho
 d being exposed to all of the target languages\, but it allows us to have 
 those methods tested throughout of all the languages.Originally focussing 
 on large-scale kernel methods and bioinformatics\, the toolbox saw massive
  extensions to other fields in recent years. It now offers features that s
 pan the whole space of Machine Learning methods\, including many classical
  methods in classification\, regression\, dimensionality reduction\, clust
 ering\, but also more advanced algorithm classes such as metric\, multi-ta
 sk\, structured output\, and online learning\, as well as feature hashing\
 , ensemble methods\, and optimization\, just to name a few. Shogun in addi
 tion contains a number of exclusive state-of-the art algorithms such as a 
 wealth of efficient SVM implementations\, Multiple Kernel Learning\, kerne
 l hypothesis testing\, Krylov methods\, etc. All algorithms are supported 
 by a collection of general purpose methods for evaluation\, parameter tuni
 ng\, preprocessing\, serialisation &amp\; I/O\, etc\; the resulting combin
 atorial possibilities are huge.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p><span style="">The KDE community has always strongly believ
 ed in openness\, in free and open source software. Today\, we’re taking 
 this mission one step further\, by bringing openness to the most important
  intellectual production of humanity: knowledge itself. And we’re not do
 ing it alone\, but with the help of institutions and professors all around
  the globe.</span></p><p><span style=""></span><span style="">What is Wiki
 ToLearn? </span><span style="">WikiToLearn is an open platform where stude
 nts\, researchers and key people in the academia can create and refine not
 es and text books\, tailored precisely to their needs\, and giving them th
 e power to customise the teaching beyond what traditional textbooks allow.
  Our philosophy inherits from the very foundation of how science works. We
  believe that “Knowledge only grows if shared” and we want learners to
  “Stand on the shoulder of giants!”</span><span style=""> </span></p><
 p><span style=""></span><span style="">Why is it an innovation?</span><spa
 n style="">WikiToLearn does not offer new knowledge. WikiToLearn offers a 
 new approach to knowledge: it rediscovers and repurposes the attitude\, no
 w almost forgotten by mankind\, that led our civilisation to take the huge
  steps that have brought us here today\, with our endless heritage of know
 ledge. Without the collaboration and the communication among the people\, 
 without the free availability of knowledge\, no big discovery would have b
 een possible. This is what we are trying to restore. We are driven by the 
 love for free knowledge\, owned by no one and accessible to everyone. </sp
 an><span style="">As volunteers\, freely collaborating between us\, we wan
 t to make this vision possible. Open source gains in this context a profou
 nd and significant meaning\, merging naturally with our philosophy.</span>
 <span style="">Any content can be modified: this leads to a continuous dev
 elopment of the existing material\, to the collaboration and communication
  among learners.</span><span style="">Everything on WikiToLearn is freely 
 accessible and can be downloaded: in this way knowledge is made available 
 to everyone.</span><span style=""> </span></p><p><span style="">         <
 /span><span style="">Why should I contribute?</span><span style="">It is r
 eally important that users contribute to the writing and the improvement o
 f the contents. This is the only way the project can be successful and be 
 able to continue to grow. Your contribution\, as small as it could be\, is
  and will always be fundamental.</span><span style="">Finding already exis
 tent\, well organised and freely accessible material can be really useful.
  However\, always bear in mind that you can find it only because someone d
 ecided to contribute to creating it.</span></p><p><span style=""></span><s
 pan style="">Moved/Driven by what? Perhaps by our same vision: the desire 
 to see\, at last\, a change in the approach to knowledge. Perhaps because 
 so you can really feel useful and part of something great\, with the power
  change the world.</span></p><p><span style=""></span><span style="">Who c
 an contribute?</span><span style=""> </span></p><ul><li><span style="">I
 ’m a university student\, I don't have time for this...</span><span styl
 e="">Your contribution is\, of course\, not solely dedicated to making Wik
 iToLearn bigger: writing and summarising are excellent tools that will hel
 p you to prepare for exams\, as well as to improve your explanation skills
 . Moreover\, this is often the best way to realise what you did not unders
 tand\, and in case you make a mistake\, someone will correct you.</span></
 li><li><span style="">But I'm a professor!- </span><span style="">WikiToL
 earn is an excellent workout for the students\, but it is also a really us
 eful tool for the teachers.</span><span style="">Reviewing the notes of yo
 ur students will help you to be aware of their understanding of each lesso
 n\, which gives you valuable feedback on the effectiveness of your teachin
 g. You can then customise your classes in order to optimise the educationa
 l path.</span><span style="">The students will consolidate their knowledge
  by writing their notes in a more organised way and\, thanks to your thoro
 ugh checking and improving\, they will be able to create evolving\, evolvi
 ng\, exhaustive\, proofread and beautifully formatted textbooks.</span></l
 i><li><span style="">I’m a coder! - </span><span style="">Do you want t
 o help WikiToLearn "under the hood"? This is the right page for you to get
  started! First of all\, you do not need to be a super expert in Computer 
 Science: there are plenty of things to do at all skill levels. You can als
 o count on the help of our developers to help get you on track to contribu
 te immediately! WikiToLearn is a project based on MediaWiki\, so we always
  need developers to fix bugs and develop new innovative programs. If you
 ’re interested in contributing to open source software\, WikiToLearn can
  be a great place.</span></li><li><span style="">I’m a translator!</span
 ><span style=""> - </span><span style="">Are you fluent in (at least) tw
 o languages? WikiToLearn needs you!</span><span style="">Translating on Wi
 kiToLearn is an opportunity to practice your translation skills\, at the s
 ame time you will learn about new things\, and you will contribute to the 
 growth of knowledge in the world . The content does not need to be written
  from scratch\, the translation into several languages is as important as 
 the content itself\, to guarantee its accessibility to everyone.</span></l

DESCRIPTION:<p>Today\, an increasing percentage of people tend to spend mo
 re time on messenger apps than on social networks. This has increased the 
 need of obtaining immediate answers to queries - giving rise to chatbots. 
 Most messaging interfaces now feature their own APIs which enable you to b
 uild bots. In this workshop\, we’ll learn how these bot APIs work\, and 
 build an interactive chatbot of our own on Slack - one of the best platfor
 ms for bot development.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p style="">Today\, even low-end computers have resources once
  only found in supercomputers. Similarly\, there is a huge selection of fr
 ee professional-quality software\, in particular (but not only) related to
  Science\, Technology\, Engineering\, and Mathematics (STEM). Yet all too 
 often\, students are only taught to use computers for basic word processin
 g or presentations and never learn to tap the computer’s power as a vers
 atile problem-solving tool\, even if it could be readily applied at school
 \, in their future careers\, and at home.</p><p style="">In my presentatio
 n\, I will demonstrate a few examples of free software we use routinely in
  our STEM teaching and research lab in areas such as computer-assisted mat
 hematics\, mechanical design\, electronic circuit design\, and data analys
 is.</p><p style="">The ultimate key to take control of the computer as a t
 ool is the ability to program it. The Python programming language is right
 fully popular in education\, academia and industry alike as it is easy to 
 learn\, yet extremely expressive and powerful. I will show examples of how
  we/our students use Python to simulate engineering designs before prototy
 ping\, control experiments\, and acquire and process data.</p><p style="">
 I will close by discussing why free software is not just about the money\,
  and how some attractive-looking free-of-charge software or online service
  schemes can actually hurt students by taking their freedom away.</p><p></

DESCRIPTION:<p>Every open source project will tell you that they want more
  design contributions and that they want their project to be easy to use\,
  beautiful\, modern\, etc. Still there are lots of complains that is hard 
 to have a designer integrated inside the community. So\, is this true? Is 
 there a mismatch between the designer and the community? Are there differe
 nces in participants' expectations?- Should the designer be involved in th
 e project from the beginning to the end? - Should the designer be also a 
 technical person? - Should the designer be responsible for the implementa
 tion of his proposals? - What we request in a design work is realistic an
 d according to designer's specialty? - How can we evaluate a designer's p
 roposals inside our community? - Can we have more than one designer invol
 ved in the community? - Do we know our target and provide full specificat
 ions when requesting design work? - Who should have the final decision on
  design proposals? - Is the designer responsible for all the usability pr
 oblems of the project?- Why it is so easy to provide design feedback?- etc
 .All the above are valid questions when interacting with designers in open
  source communities and some times the answers don't match. Stating very c
 lear what the expectations are can be helpful in having long term design c
 ontributions. In this presentation we will go over the common questions an
 d expectations designers and open source communities have and try to provi
 de a base for design work interactions.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>The MySQL Group Replication feature is a multi-master updat
 e anywhere replication plugin for MySQL with built-in conflict detection a
 nd resolution\, automatic distributed recovery\, and group membership. MyS
 QL released GA version of Group Replication plugin on Dec 12 2012 (MySQL 5
 .7.17).MySQL Group Replication provides distributed state machine replicat
 ion with strong coordination between servers. Servers coordinate themselve
 s automatically when they are part of the same group. The group can operat
 e in a single-primary mode with automatic primary election\, where only on
 e server accepts updates at a time. Alternatively\, for more advanced user
 s the group can be deployed in multi-primary mode\, where all servers can 
 accept updates\, even if they are issued concurrently. There is a built-in
  group membership service that keeps the view of the group consistent and 
 available for all servers at any given point in time.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>In this workshop\, i will show on how easy and fast to buil
 d a mobile application for both IOS and Android OS. They don't have to kno
 w about Java\, Xcode or Swift\, it is just need knowledge about Javascript
 .The framework that we will be using it is Nativescript\, a fully free\, o
 pen source mobile framework. Build truly native iOS and Android mobile app
 s. Get 100% native API access with Javascript\, TypeScript or Angular.We a
 re going to build a "FOSSASIA registration application" within 1 hour. Par
 ticipants should learn and understand basic of Nativescript (<a href="http
 ://docs.nativescript.org/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.nat
 ivescript.org/)</a>\, or atleast learn how to install it (find at <a href

DESCRIPTION:<p>Art\, design\, and cultural events and organisations have p
 roliferated in Indonesia in various scales. Designers\, artists\, research
 ers\, environmentalists\, handymen\, technologists\, hobbyists\, entrepren
 eurs and government use open source licenses and tools mixed with assembla
 ges of media technologies\, “pirated” softwares and hardwares. Using t
 wo case studies\, i.e. (1) Design It Yourself conference in Surabaya\; and
  (2) Senayan SLiMS\, an open-source Library Management Systems\, I elabora
 te how various individuals and organisations (de)couple\, calibrate\, cobb
 le up repair and maintenance in facing social or environmental challenges 
 and emerging technologies in Indonesia. And how in the process\, they gene
 rate networks of solidarity\, tension\, innovation\, power\, breakdown and
  resilience\, across different boundaries.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>The MySQL Replication Team at ORACLE has been striving to p
 rovide community with great replication features. It is time to celebrate 
 again. This talk aims at providing a brief overview of all the awesome fea
 tures that are available as part of MySQL-5.7.They cover a lot of differen
 t technical areas\, with special emphasis on: Usability/Online: Online Re
 configuration of “Global Transaction Identifiers”\, Online reconfigura
 tion of “Replication Filters” and Online fail over to a new master. Im
 proved replication monitoring which is more flexible and user friendly.Per
 formance: Improved “User threads – Sender threads” synchronization\,
  Locking based parallelism\, new “Ack Receiver” thread which makes “
 Semi – sync Replication” faster and a faster “Sender Thread”.Depen
 dability: “Loss-less Semi – Sync Replication” and “Wait for multip
 le acks”.Flexibility: Storing “Global Transaction Identifiers” in a 
 Table and “Multi – source Replication”.Moreover\, development contin
 ues and the team already has some very interesting feature previews on lab
 s\, such as a new and exciting replication plugin: MySQL Group Replication
 . Seize the opportunity to get together with some of the engineers behind
  the product and learn about the exciting new replication world in MySQL 5
 .7 and beyond.</p>
